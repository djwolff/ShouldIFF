### Task

The task of this project is to provide a prediction to players who are considering on surrendering early in a League of Legends game. Deciding on whether or not to surrender early not only saves time for the players, but also alleviates stress that may occur during the game.


### Approach

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/djwolff/ShouldIFF/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
